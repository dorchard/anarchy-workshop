## Overview

**THE PROBLEM:** Much of PL research is done in a way that makes it easy to evaluate the work using a small number of methods - one can write formal models with proofs, implement things that can be measured or perform controlled user studies. As a result, "the course of our investigation is deflected into narrow channels of things already understood."

**WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM:** This is a problem because many interesting ideas about programming do not have space in the modern programming language research community, because we do not yet know how to evaluate them and as a result, we see them as "unscientific".

**THE SOLUTION:** The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue where such ideas can be presented and discussed. In the absence of "objective" evaluation methods, our only resort is to rely on "subjective" criticism. The workshop will take inspiration from literary criticism - submissions that provoke interesting discussions will be published together with a review that presents an alternative position, additional context or summary of discussion at the workshop. 

**WHAT ARE THE CONSEQENCES:** The methodology of critical commentary makes it possible to explore a much wider space of programming ideas than those that are currently covered by main-stream PL conferences. This workshop aims to explore new corners of the space, including both areas where subjective criticism is the only option, but also areas where more objective evaluation is possible, but has not yet been discovered.

## Questions & Answers

What will we publish?  Each published submission will be accompanied with a critical review written either by a PC member or by one of the workshop attendees (with PC member serving as a shepherd to ensure the quality of the review). This complements the "idea" paper with an evaluation and context.

How will we accept papers?  We will accept papers for which the PC members are willing to serve as critics (or will be able to find someone else in the community - possibly among the workshop attendees or authors of other submissions - who would accept this role).  This means we will accept any work that inspires interesting discussion.

What topics we're interested in?  The workshop itself is open to a wide range of programming related topics. This very much depends on the PC members and so we'll expect that each PC member will write a short paragraph about things they are interested in. 

## Philosophical motivation

TBD: I think there is a space for a brief section in the workshop proposal about the philosophical motivations for this (i.e. we are far from being the only people around who think that something like the above is needed for progressing the science). Below are some random quotes that might fit.

> If a subject does not permit exactness, it is not sufficient to be exact about something else. (Realms of Value, Ralph Barton Perry)

> The alternative (...) which I am seeking to establish here, is to restore to us once more the power 
> for the deliberate holding of improved beliefs. We should be able to profess now knowingly and openly 
> those beliefs which could be tacitly taken for granted in the days before modern philosophic 
> criticism reached its present incisiveness. (Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi)

> Objectivity is the delusion that observations could be made without an observer. (Heinz von Foerster)

> To 'clarify' the terms of a discussion does not mean to study the additional and as yet unknown properties of the
> domain in question which one needs to make them fully understood, it means to fill them with existing notions
> from the entirely different domain of logic and common sense, (...) and to take care that the process of filling 
> obeys the accepted laws of logic. So the course of an investigation is deflected into the narrow channels of 
> things already understood and the possibility of fundamental conceptual discovery is significantly reduced. (Against Method, Paul Feyerabend)
